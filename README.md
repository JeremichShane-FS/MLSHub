## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This project uses `concurrently`, an npm package that allows you to run multiple npm scripts simultaneously. This is particularly useful in a development environment where you might want to run a server and a client at the same time. However, using `concurrently` is not mandatory. You can also navigate (`cd`) into the `client` and `server` directories and run the script `npm run dev` for each one to start the front end and backend, respectively. This approach requires running multiple terminal windows. `Concurrently` simply makes it easier to manage both processes simultaneously.

The project also includes a sample environment file (`.env.sample`). This file contains environment variables that are necessary for the application to run correctly.

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install `concurrently` and other dependencies**: If you do not have `concurrently` installed globally, make sure you're in the root directory of the project and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install concurrently
   ```

   This command will install `concurrently` in the root directory, provided that you ran `npm install concurrently` from the root directory. If you already have `concurrently` installed globally, or you wish to not install `concurrently` then you can skip this step.
   <br>

2. **Install dependencies in the client and server directories**: Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

This command will set up the project, including installing all the necessary dependencies in both the client and server directories.

3. **Set up the environment file**: During the installation process, the `.env.sample` file will be automatically renamed to `.env`, allowing the application to access these variables.

After all dependencies are installed and the `.env` files in both the server and client directories is set up, you can start both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This setup allows for a streamlined development process, as both servers can be managed from a single terminal instance.

## üì¢ &nbsp; Milestone Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going.

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Milestone 1

For this milestone I've created a wireframe prototype in Figma.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/e9k60esuwNFIxpMFG6kvUE/MLSHub?node-id=0-1&t=tZdTgxfhh9UCJWOn-0)

<br>

### Milestone 2

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - This past week, I've made significant strides in my project. I started with the initial setup of the projects, folders, and files for both the frontend and backend of the application. I then set up routes using the react-router-dom library and completed the Navbar and Header components. Regarding HTML updates, I modified the project title to match the project name and added a MLS favicon. A significant portion of my time was spent on styling, where I finished stylizing the login component and then created and styled the Profile component. Throughout the week, I also made several updates to the README file to document my progress. I plan to continue building out the application's functionality and addressing any challenges.

<br>

üåµ Challenges - Time management has been a challenge for me this week in real-life situations. But apart from that, I've also faced the challenge of implementing my APIs or database to cache the information so I can build out the rest of my components.

<br>

üèÜ Accomplishments - For accomplishments, it's just getting my folder structure in place, my routes implemented, and the project to compile and run on localhost so I can see it in action.

<br>

üîÆ Next Steps - The following steps are to work with my APIs for the data, build my database with Mongo DB to cache it, and then map it into my react Project to finish building my missing components.

<br>

Please discuss the following:

#### Page #1

- Newsfeed
- This page will display all the current trending news with MLS. Right now their is placeholders as it will be replaced with the information coming from the APIs.

#### Page #2

- Login
- This page is to authenticate a User to access their profile page. This page will store their information such as name, email, password, and their favorite team. Their favorite team can be used in future versions to customize the information specific to their favorite team.

#### Page #3

- Profile
- Once the user is logged in they can access their User Profile. This will have their information and they'll be able to update it. The user should be stored into the database.

#### Page #4

- Sign up
- If the user does not have an account registered with MLS Hub, they can use this page to sign up, which will then be saved to the database and can access their profile page.

<br>

### Milestone 3

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - Write overview here.
Over the past week, significant progress has been made on the project. The Swiper library was installed to enhance the scoreboard on the home page component, creating a more interactive and visually appealing user experience. Axios and dotenv were added to the backend server to streamline API requests and manage environment variables securely. The frontend application set up a context for Articles, Standings, and Fixtures to handle state management more efficiently. Data successfully caches with the MongoDB database. Images were added to the assets directory, and API requests for the front end were configured. The standings component was implemented and styled, clearly displaying rankings. Similarly, the newsfeed component was completed, along with modular newsfeed cards, contributing to the overall functionality and design of the home page component.

üåµ Challenges - Write challenges here.
This week, I faced several challenges. Learning and using the Swiper library to improve the scoreboard on the home page was challenging and took a lot of time. I also had trouble getting the APIs to store data correctly in the MongoDB database, which required careful setup and debugging. Managing my time was complicated since this project was complex, and balancing all the tasks was demanding. Despite these challenges, I learned a lot and improved my handling of complex projects.

üèÜ Accomplishments - Write Accomplishments here.
This week, I made significant progress on my project. I installed and integrated the Swiper library to enhance the scoreboard on the home page. I set up the backend, including the server, database connections, models, controllers, and routes. I implemented and styled various frontend components, such as the standings, newsfeed, scoreboard, and footer. I optimized the SCSS files and fixed various styling issues. I also updated React Router for navigation and added context providers for state management. Lastly, I updated the README and git ignore files and prepared the project for easy setup with .env files.
